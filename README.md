# Traffic-Density-Sensors
a density based 4 way automatic traffic signal control system using Arduino and IR Sensor
This project is aimed at traffic signal system 
Where the timings of signal will change automatically on sensing the traffic density at any junction to optimize the problem of traffic
Sometimes higher traffic density at one side of junction demands longer green time as compared to standard allotted time. 
Sometimes higher traffic density at one side of junction demands longer green time as compared to standard allotted time. 
We therefore, propose here a mechanism in which the time period of green light and red light is assigned on the basis of density of the traffic present at that time. 
We are making a framework for an intelligent traffic control system.
